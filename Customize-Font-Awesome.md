Font Awesome receives dozens of new requests every day. Some of them will eventually be included, others will not. [Popularity](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+icon%22+sort%3Acomments-desc) is one of the factors taken into account, but it is not the only one.

So, if you need a new icon in a short while, or you need a comprehensive set of icons (e.g., a set of weather icons to build a forecast application) our suggestion is to customize Font Awesome.

## The Easy Way

There are some wonderful online services which allows you to customize Font Awesome, like:

- Fort Awesome: https://fortawesome.com/ (by **@davegandy**, creator of Font Awesome)
- Fontello: http://fontello.com/
- IcoMoon: http://icomoon.io/app/#/select ([How To](https://dyscribe.com/article/create-your-own-custom-iconfont/))
- Fontastic: http://fontastic.me/

Pick up the one which better fits your needs.

## The Hard Way

*Note that you may need commercial software*

1. [Fork](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/fork) the repository. You need a properly configured development environment
2. Hack with the `.otf` file. Here it is a guide you can follow: [The making of Octicons](https://github.com/blog/1135-the-making-of-octicons)
3. Share with the Font Awesome community. Check for [open issues](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues) that are related to your fork and share your repository

# New styles

If you don't need new icons but have special needs for your stylesheet, please consider a custom build based on `.less` or `.scss` versions.
